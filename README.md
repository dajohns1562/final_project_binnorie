# Project 2 - Binnorie Dairy Farm

## Description

This project was a site redesign for one of our favourite cheese makers, Binnorie Dairy. Binnorie is a a small artisan cheese maker in the Hunter Valley that specialises in soft cheeses made from organic local cow and goat milk.

Our motivation for this project came from our love of their tasty and voluptuous cheeses and a slight aversion to the aesthetics of their existing website.

We hope you find our work to be as delicious as their Dueto: a light gorgonzola whipped with fresh cream.   

## Technical Objective

Our objective was to deploy a rails application with checkout functionality powered by Stripe. We wanted to improve our understanding of the MVC model in rails and to get experience using APIs via webhooks.
