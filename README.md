# Project 2 - Binnorie Dairy Farm

## Description

Ever worried about your Mum seeing something you posted on social media? Have a group chat so hilarious that you cringe at the thought of it being made public?

If the answer to any of these questions is yes, you need Circle. Circle is a social media app where you can build trusted communities to selectively share content with.

If you want to share a photo of a night out with the friends who were there, your "close friends" circle is a click away. Maybe you want to humble brag about a win at work. Simply post to your "colleagues" circle.

## Technical Objective

Our objective was to build a secure social network site using real-time user interactions on ReactJS with core features of the platform to include â€“ users, profiles, posts, a feed, live messaging, comments and likes.
